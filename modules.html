      <h2 class="section-title">Complete Curriculum — University Track</h2>
      <p class="small">This is the full course. Each Module includes lessons, examples, exercises, and a short checklist to practice. Read through sequentially and do the exercises — the curriculum is designed to build a reliable trading skill set rather than promise a quick win.</p>

    <!-- Module 1 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 1 — Market Foundations (Understanding the ecosystem)</h3>
      <p>Markets are where buyers and sellers meet. The main markets covered here are equities (stocks), derivatives (options), and forex. Exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) match orders; brokers provide access to these markets. You must understand order types (market, limit, stop, stop-limit), liquidity, spreads, and slippage to manage executions effectively.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Order Types & Execution:</b> Market orders execute immediately at the best available price; limit orders control price but may not fill; stop orders become market/limit orders when triggered.</li>
        <li><b>Liquidity & Spreads:</b> Popular tickers have tight bid/ask spreads and deep liquidity. Illiquid tickers create slippage and poor fills — avoid when learning.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Open a demo account and place examples of market/limit/stop orders. Note execution differences and fill quality.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="small">Exercise: Practice 5 order types on a demo and take notes in your journal.</div>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 2 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 2 — How to Read Candlestick Charts</h3>
      <p>Candlesticks show the open, high, low, and close for a period. Their bodies and wicks communicate buyer/seller conviction. Master single-candle patterns (Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star) and multi-candle patterns (Engulfing, Harami). Use volume to confirm signals — high volume adds weight to breakouts and reversals.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> Study 100+ candles on daily and intraday charts. Mark Dojis and Rejection candles.</li>
        <li><b>Context Matters:</b> A bearish pattern in an uptrend isn't as powerful as one at resistance. Always check higher timeframe context.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Identify 20 Hammer or Shooting Star formations and note whether they resulted in trend continuation or reversal over the next 3 sessions.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 3 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 3 — Beginner’s Guide to Stocks & Forex</h3>
      <p>Stocks represent company ownership; forex trades currency pairs. Stocks are influenced by fundamentals (earnings, guidance) and news, while forex is dominated by macroeconomic events (interest rates, CPI). For beginners, stocks & ETFs are simpler because they don’t require understanding two-legged currency moves.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Stocks:</b> Focus on liquid names and ETFs like SPY/QQQ to learn price action.</li>
        <li><b>Forex:</b> Understand pips, lot sizes, and how leverage affects risk. Forex often uses higher leverage; manage carefully.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Build a watchlist of 5 tickers and track news/events for 14 days to see correlation between news and price movement.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 4 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 4 — Options Explained (Calls, Puts & Chains)</h3>
      <p>Options are contracts giving the right, not the obligation, to buy/sell at a strike before expiry. Key terms: strike, expiry, premium, intrinsic/extrinsic value, Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega). Understand option chains and liquidity before choosing a contract. Buying options gives defined risk; selling naked options can expose unlimited risk — avoid selling uncovered unless very experienced.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Greeks:</b> Delta - directional exposure; Theta - time decay; Vega - volatility sensitivity.</li>
        <li><b>Choosing Contracts:</b> Use higher open interest and tighter spreads. For beginners, favor vertical spreads (defined risk).</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Read an option chain for AAPL or SPY and mark ATM/ITM/OTM strikes across two expirations.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 5 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 5 — Risk Management & Position Sizing</h3>
      <p>This is the most important module. Risk management wins over raw returns. Rules: never risk more than 1–2% of account on a single trade; define stop loss and position size before entry; use risk/reward ratios (1:2 minimal). Plan how much you will lose daily/monthly and stop trading when those limits are reached. Use smaller position sizes with options due to leverage and potential loss of premium.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Position Sizing:</b> Convert dollar risk to contract size. Example: $50 max risk and each contract risks $5 means 10 contracts.</li>
        <li><b>Stop Placement:</b> Place stops beyond structural support/resistance—not on arbitrary penny distance.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Calculate position sizes for a $10,000 account using 1% risk per trade on three different setups.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 6 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 6 — Advanced Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>Dive into indicators: RSI for momentum and divergence, MACD for trend/acceleration, Bollinger Bands for range and volatility. Combine indicators (confluence) rather than relying on a single tool. Study moving average behavior (EMAs) across timeframes and use VWAP for intraday context.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Multi-timeframe Analysis:</b> Use daily to set bias and 5/15-min for entries.</li>
        <li><b>Divergence:</b> Price vs. indicator divergences can signal weakening trends.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Backtest a simple RSI-MACD combined rule on 3 tickers for 3 months (paper trading).</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 7 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 7 — Strategy Building & Execution</h3>
      <p>Build strategies around your edge. Define entry criteria, stop rules, profit targets, and size. Use checklists before entering a trade. Keep strategies simple—avoid mixing too many signals. Backtest and forward test on paper/demo before going live.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Edge:</b> A repeatable, profitable setup with positive expectancy after fees and slippage.</li>
        <li><b>Execution:</b> Use limit orders or limit+aggressive orders depending on objective. For scalps, speed matters; for swing trades, fills matter more than speed.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Design one simple trend-pullback and one mean-reversion setup. Paper trade 20 times each and log results.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 8 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 8 — Volatility & Earnings</h3>
      <p>Implied volatility (IV) drives options pricing. Around earnings, IV rises (premium expensive) and often collapses after the event (IV crush). Know IV Rank and IV Percentile to decide whether to buy or sell premium. Hedging and defined-risk selling strategies can work when IV is high.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>IV Rank/Percentile:</b> Helps identify whether current IV is high or low historically.</li>
        <li><b>Earnings Plays:</b> Avoid buying options purely for direction through earnings unless probability and risk are acceptable.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Record IV rank for 10 tickers before earnings and observe post-earnings premium behavior.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 9 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 9 — Journaling & Psychology</h3>
      <p>Keep a disciplined journal: ticker, date/time, setup reason, entry, size, stop, exit, result, emotional state. Review weekly. Psychology: avoid revenge trading, accept losses, manage stress, and maintain a routine. Growth comes from consistent small improvements.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Journal Template:</b> Entry thesis, risk per trade, outcome, lesson.</li>
        <li><b>Review Cycle:</b> Weekly pattern review and monthly performance summary.</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Keep a 30-day demo journal and compile metrics (win rate, avg gain/loss, expectancy).</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Module 10 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Module 10 — Building a Trading Business</h3>
      <p>Scale from hobbyist to trader with business thinking: capital allocation, diversification, record-keeping for taxes, professional tools, and community. Build consistent processes—automation and backtesting can boost efficiency. If trading becomes a primary income source, consult a tax pro for trader vs investor status and records.</p>
      <h4>Lessons</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Scaling:</b> Increase size only after consistent positive expectancy.</li>
        <li><b>Recordkeeping:</b> Use spreadsheets or software to export trades (P&L, fees, realized/unrealized).</li>
        <li><b>Practice:</b> Create a 3-month plan to scale a winning demo strategy to small live size.</li>
      </ol>
